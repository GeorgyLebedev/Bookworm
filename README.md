# Project description
The project is a book online store with enhanced functionality, including a shopping cart, authentication system, order payment page, and an administrative section for content management.

## Technologies used:
- SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) for more convenient and flexible web page styling.
- TypeScript (TS) to add static typing to JavaScript code, making project development and maintenance easier.
- Vue 3 - a modern JavaScript framework for building interfaces using a component-based architecture.
- WebSocket to enable bidirectional communication between the client and server, allowing interactive features such as online chat.
- Nuxt.js - a framework for creating universal applications with Vue.js, simplifying Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and static site generation.
- SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) for exchanging structured information messages in XML format.

## Project functionality:
1. Shopping Cart: ability to add products to the cart, modify quantities, and place orders.
2. Authentication System: registration and authentication of users to access personalized information.
3. Payment Page: integration of payment systems for secure and convenient order payments.
4. Administrative Section: capability to manage the product catalog, orders, users, and other aspects of the store.
